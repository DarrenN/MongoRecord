h1. MongoRecord

MongoRecord is a PHP Mongo ORM layer built on top of the PHP "Mongo PECL extension":http://pecl.php.net/package/mongo 

MongoRecord is an extraction from online classifieds site Oodle:http://www.oodle.com. Oodle's requirements for a manageable, easy to understand interface for dealing with the super-scalable Mongo datastore was the primary reason for MongoRecord. It was developed to use with PHP applications looking to add Mongo's scaling capabilities while dealing with a nice abstraction layer.

h2. Features

* Collection names by convention
* Attributes by convention
* Validations
* Callbacks

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.3+
* Mongo PECL

h2. Installation

Extract the source files into a directory in your PHP library path.

h2. Usage

h3. Basic

Using MongoRecord is as simple as declaring classes that are extensions of the base ORM class.

pre.. 
class Person extends BaseMongoRecord
{
}

// initialize connection and database name
BaseMongoRecord::$connection = new Mongo();
BaseMongoRecord::$database = 'myapp';

p. 
This gives @Person@ basic CRUD methods: @save()@, @destroy()@, @findOne()@, and @find()@.

Every class automatically gets mapped to a Mongo collection by convention.

E.g.
@Person@ -> @people@
@MyClass@ -> @my_classes@

h3. Creating and Fetching

New records can be created by instantiating and saving:

pre.. 
$person = new Person();
$person->save(); // true or false depending on success

$person = Person::findOne();
$person->destroy();

h3. Attributes

Attributes can be set in bulk on the constructor, one-by-one, or chained.

pre.. 
$person = new Person(array('name' => 'Bob', 'description' => 'foobar'));
$person->setAge(25)->setGender("Male");
$person->save(); // returns true or false

Person::find(array('name' => 'Bob', 'gender' => 'Male')); // finds all male Bobs in the people collection.

h3. Validations

Validations can be added based on the name of the attribute

pre.. 

class Person extends BaseMongoRecord
{
    public function validatesName($name)
    {
        if ($name == 'Bob')
            return false;
        else
            return true;
    }
}

$person = new Person();
$person->setName("Bob");
$person->save(); // fails!

h3. Callbacks

Callbacks can be added for the following events:

* beforeSave()
* afterSave()
* beforeValidation()
* afterValidation()
* beforeDestroy()
* afterNew()

In a new, save, destroy cycle, the validations are called in the following order:

@afterNew -> beforeValidation -> afterValidation -> beforeSave -> afterSave -> beforeDestroy@

pre.. 
class Person extends BaseMongoRecord
{
    public function beforeSave()
    {
         if ($this->getName() == 'Bob')
             $this->setName('Bill');
    }
}
